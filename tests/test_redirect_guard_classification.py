"""Regression tests for #175: a guard-refused redirect must stay a redirect.

``fetch_one`` used to catch ``_guard_redirect``'s ``ValueError`` in the same broad
``except Exception`` as every transport failure, so a page whose ``Location``
pointed at a private address (169.254.169.254, the cloud metadata endpoint, is
the canonical example) was recorded with ``status_code=None`` and
``redirect_url=""`` — a transport error, indistinguishable from a flaky host,
even though the origin answered in full and the SSRF was correctly refused.

Two things are tested at two different layers, on purpose:

* ``test_guard_refusal_stops_before_the_second_hop`` exercises
  ``recon.net``'s event hooks directly, over an ``httpx.MockTransport``, and
  proves the structural half of the acceptance criterion: the handler that
  stands in for "the network" is invoked exactly once, for the original URL —
  never for the refused destination.
* ``test_a_redirect_to_a_private_address_is_recorded_not_swallowed`` runs the
  real collector (``collect_urls``) against a real loopback HTTP server, so the
  fix is exercised through the same client construction, event hooks, and
  pinning transport a live crawl uses — not a test double standing in for them.
