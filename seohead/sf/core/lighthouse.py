"""Lighthouse audit correspondence (issue #59).

Lighthouse (github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse, Apache-2.0) is the audit
engine behind PageSpeed Insights. Every audit ships a stable ``id`` plus a
public documentation URL; where one of our checks independently reimplements
a documented rule *from its description* (never from Lighthouse's source —
see PROVENANCE.md/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md on the MIT/Apache-2.0 boundary), this
module records the correspondence so the claim is inspectable and testable,
per the issue's acceptance criteria.

``LIGHTHOUSE_AUDIT_IDS`` is the ground truth ``tests/test_lighthouse_map.py``
checks every cited id against: every ``id: '...'`` a ``static get meta()``
declares under ``core/audits/**`` in GoogleChrome/lighthouse. Regenerate it
with the snippet in ``LIGHTHOUSE_SNAPSHOT`` if the mapping test ever needs a
newer snapshot.

Two Lighthouse audits named in the issue (``uses-text-compression``,
``uses-long-cache-ttl``) plus ``viewport`` and ``modern-http`` no longer exist
at that snapshot: Lighthouse's 2025 "Insights" migration folded them into
trace-gated successors (``document-latency-insight``, ``cache-insight``,
``viewport-insight``, ``modern-http-insight``) that read a performance trace
Lighthouse itself records. Our checks below never run a trace; each one
reimplements the *retired* classic audit's static rule from its own
description (still live at the linked ``doc_url``) against the response and
markup a crawl already has. A check's ``note`` says so explicitly, and the
hard rule from the issue still holds: none of this is, or can be mistaken
for, that Insight's actual score.
